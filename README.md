Here I covered both Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Techniques with Practical Implementation. Everything from scratch and I solved a lot of different problems with different Machine Learning techniques . 
The Topic that are covered in this repository are:

  **Supervised Machine Learning**
  
          i. Classfication
          
                     a) Naive Bayes Classifier(NB)
                     
                     b) Logisttic Regression
                    
                     c) k-Nearest Neighbors(kNN)
                     
                     d) Decision Tree Classifier
                     
                     e) Random Forrest Classifier
